						This is my switching power supply from HQ-Power.
						It has a range of 0-20V and 0-10A, I needed a lot of current for some of my projects !
						This power supply has a big LCD display for
						monitoring the voltage, current and power.
						You can adjust any parameter with the main knob and adjust with the "coarse" and "fine" buttons.
						It's fully programmable and is quite well electrically protected!
						</br>
						</br>
						The only feature i miss on this one, is the lack of multiple channels for certain applications.

					<div id="article-text">
						Rigol makes quite good low & mid-range scopes, I bought this one just after release!
						This Rigol scope is a 50MHz bandwidth digital
						oscilloscope who scores pretty well for the price!
						It has 4 channels and a wide 7inch screen
						with good contrast. Lots of build in features and parameters you can adjust, the math button provides a wide variety of function you can apply to your signals. The interface from Rigol is much more intuitive than other brands. (something scope manufacturers don't pay much attention for)
						</br></br>
						I have no regrets for this purchase, it's absolutely the best scope you can have for this price range (for the moment)!

						This dual trace analog oscilloscope from L.E. Corp. of 20MHz BW is quite old, but still usefull for pure analog signals who are modulated (AM, FM...)
						</br></br>
						If you like to work with analog circuits, I recommend to have one like this, easier to tune for pure analog signals. If you consider playing with pure analog low frequency stuff, I would recommend to buy some second hand analog scope.

					<div id="article-text">
						I was searching for a good soldering station because my projects were demanding a more professional work (fine pitch SMD components, large ground planes...) I searched through the web for the best â‰¤ 100 EUR soldering station and compared some of the well known brands like Weller and Hakko. But for a cheaper price I finally chose Atten, from what I experienced, this soldering station of 80W does very well, didn't noticed a big difference with the more expensive brands. My ST-80 has three buttons for pre programming temperatures, heats up in no time! And has an automatic cooling down function to protect the tip, the time for this feature is programmable. Heat transfer is excellent and soldering pen doesn't heat up. you can easily solder with it the whole day.
						</br></br>
						I also suggest to buy a range of different tips, if you consider soldering fine pitch SMD components.

						This multimeter follows me since I started in the world of electronics ! I had to replace some fuses and change two or three times the 9V battery, but that's all, the rest is very robust. If you take care of your stuff, this machine is unbreakable!
						</br></br>
						Very good meter, but I will consider in a near futur to purchase an other one, with true RMS capabilities. I keep this one because of nostalgia.

					<div id="article-text">
						The Chinese brand Aneng was unknown a few years ago, it has become a leader in low/mid range multimeters. I bought this compact (surprisingly compact) meter just to have another reference when I do some measurements. This multimeter has better capabilities and superior specs than my first multimeter. 
						</br></br>
						The price tag and the incredible true RMS feature makes it one of the best meters of its pricerange.

					<div id="article-text">
						I wanted a 3D printer obviousely, I waited for the hype to calm down and for the survivors of the first 3 years to show up.
						This Cetus 3D printer is very simple, the least amount of moving parts, minimal mechanical play in the x/y/z-axis thanks to the linear rails.
						I also bought the heating bed for better adhesion and less warping. I has different nozzles: 0,2mm up to 0,6mm.
						I'm not a 3D print specialist, but compaired to a Ultimaker 3, it has nothing to envy.
						</br></br>
						I can't complain about this printer, the price is low (sub 400EUR), and everything is easily fixable.

					<div id="article-text">
						My second power supply is a PeakTech 6210, it's a linear lab power supply. Has 4 channels from which 2 are adjustable 0-30V/0-5A and the other two are fixed 5V supplies with 1A capability.
						This supply is not very powerfull but has multiple channels which is very convenient for some project.
						</br></br>
						This kind of lab equipment is always a good investment. You never have enough channels and if I need more power, I just take my PSS-2010.

					<div id="article-text">
						This equipment is less common, but so usefull if you want to solder 0201 resistors and caps, or if you want some small pitch SMD work.
						The stereo view gives you a 3D perspective and makes it easier to manipulate and work on difficult PCB's.
						The telescopic arm gives you the freedom to move the head of the microcope wherever you want on the bench.
						It's also less tiresome for your eyes to work on precise stuff when you have a good microscope.
						</br></br>
						This is expensive equipment, but if you want to start to work seriousely on very fine pitch PCB projects, i recommand to invest in this kind of equipment.
